Fake news detection using NLP 
Introduction:  
Fake news distributions at an unprecedented rate cause substantial societal challenges within 
the modern digital environment. The dissemination of deceptive and completely fabricated 
news material affects how the public views matters along with election results and public 
health outcomes and other areas. Manual human detection of fake news proves both difficult 
and inefficient when considering the daily massive online information distribution. The project 
establishes a goal to create automated platform for fake news detection through Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) methods that determines whether news articles represent real or 
fabricated content. 
Problem Statement: 
Social media along with online platforms distribute false information in a widespread manner 
which endangers truth and both democratic principles and social order. A crucial imperative 
exists for automated systems to determine insincere news content in written articles 
effectively. Analyzing the challenging nature of language presents difficulties when using text 
features for detection between truth and deception.
