# Fake news detection using NLP
### Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainpooja/fake-news-detection
## Introduction: 
Fake news distributions at an unprecedented rate cause substantial societal challenges within the modern digital environment. The dissemination of deceptive and completely fabricated news material affects how the public views matters along with election results and public health outcomes and other areas. Manual human detection of fake news proves both difficult and inefficient when considering the daily massive online information distribution. The project establishes a goal to create automated platform for fake news detection through Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that determines whether news articles represent real or fabricated content.
## Problem Statement:
Social media along with online platforms distribute false information in a widespread manner which endangers truth and both democratic principles and social order. A crucial imperative exists for automated systems to determine insincere news content in written articles effectively. Analyzing the challenging nature of language presents difficulties when using text features for detection between truth and deception.
## My objective is: 
1.	To collect data which contains fake news and real news.
2.	Preprocess the data.
3.	To extract relevant textual features using NLP techniques.
4.	To build and evaluate various machine learning models for fake news classification.
5.	To create a system that can predict the authenticity of a news article based on its content.
## Methodology
1.	Data collection: Using datasets that are publicly available on Kaggle, LIAR, and ISOT fake news datasets. That will help me train my AI model so it could detect the fake news and the real news.
2.	Data preprocessing: Machine learning models require the preprocessing phase to process textual data effectively. The initial operation starts with tokenization because raw news articles get divided into separate tokens. The unstructured text undergoes this process to produce manageable units that facilitate analysis and feature extraction. The preprocessing phase includes stop-word removal as its subsequent step. Stop-words including “and,” “the,” or “is” do not contain important meaning so they get eliminated to reduce data noise in processing. The model achieves better text analysis by removing these words since they carry minimal value in the text. The following step consists of lemmatization which simplifies words to their fundamental core forms. Every occurrence of “running” and “ran” becomes “run” within the text during the procedure. Guest normalization standardizes all word variants in the text so that the model treats them uniformly. The last step involves turning textual information into numerical forms that allow machine learning algorithms to work with it. The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach serves alongside three generations of word embedding models including Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT. Models require these techniques to detect word semantics because they help develop efficient model structures.
3.	Building the model: The initial step of model building includes deployment of machine learning models starting with Logistic Regression along with Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models establish an initial foundation to help evaluate complex systems that follow them. They often perform well with efficiently designed features and enable system developers to assess their first performance. This project seeks to explore deep learning models specifically made to process sequential text information because it aims for better system performance. The text processing ability of both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models enables them to interpret text dependencies and context. Transformer-based models mainly use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) due to its excellent performance in processing natural language along with context understanding. Standard evaluation metrics assist in determining the effectiveness of the developed models. The evaluation metrics consist of Accuracy and Precision with Recall alongside F1-Score. These evaluation metrics enable model assessments of fake news and real news classification accuracy while maintaining balanced performance regardless of error type.
4.	System design: The system will become more usable through its web-based interface which enables users to input news articles or headlines for receiving instant authenticity predictions. The easy-to-use platform through which non-technical users can operate with the fake news detection system exists via this interface. The monitored interface depends on the trained machine learning models for backend functionality. The integrated backend processing enables the system to handle data input in real-time for classification purposes. When a user submits news material for evaluation the backend system uses the preprocessing pipeline to process the data before applying trained models to yield and present prediction results. The configuration allows the system to run smoothly with optimum efficiency when deployed for practical use.
